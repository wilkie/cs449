**Weight**: 10% of your total 50% Lab Grade

**Note**: Start early enough to get through the more troublesome parts of debugging this one!

**Note**: You must use `malloc` and not use `calloc` nor `realloc` in this assignment!

## Introduction

This assignment will give you practice in the finer aspects of C programming necessary to
succeed in later assignments in this course. These skills include:

* Explicit memory management (which C requires.)
* Creating and manipulating data structures using pointers.
* Working with strings.
* Choosing an implementation of a data structure that has particular performance characteristics.
* Properly handling error cases (such as when `malloc` returns `NULL`.)

To do this, we will implement a queue data structure. Such a data structure, as you should
recall, supports fast insert and remove operations. In this case, we will implement the queue
such that it provides both fast last-in-first-out (LIFO) and first-in-first-out (FIFO) capability.

As you might presume, to do this we will implement the queue using a singly linked list specifically
implemented to make the queue operations efficient when we can.

## Resources

Beyond the lecture material, which should help greatly, you may consult several online and offline
resources.

1. *C Programming* - **The C Programming Language** (second edition) by Kernighan and Ritchie,
which is a very recommended book. You may find copies
on reserve in many libraries on campus. Chapters 5 and 6 are particularly relevant in the newest
edition. A good online book is also [C Programming](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming) by
the editors of wikibooks.

2. *Linked Lists* - If you want alternative resources to my own lecture material, hunt down any
current data structures course and review their notes there. For instance, the linked list slides
by my friend [Michael Lipschultz](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~lipschultz/cs445/notes07.html).

3. *Asymptotic (big-Oh) notation* - If you still need a refresher on what `O(n)` means, Vinicius
recommends these [Cornell lecture notes](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2012sp/lectures/lec19-asymp/review.html)
on the subject. It is indeed a great summation of the topic, albeit dense at the same time.

4. *C Reference* - Searching the internet for function names will get you a long way.
Often it will point you to [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c), which is a classic
online manual for different functions.

Namely, you will want to refer to the specifics of the functions `malloc` and `free`. You are not
permitted to use `calloc` or any alternative memory allocation function.

Also, be sure to review the behavior of string functions `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strncpy`. This
[string guide](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte) lists each string function and a
short description.

**Hint**: `strncpy` has strange behavior when truncating strings! It does not necessarily add a
`NULL` terminator.

**Note**: Academic integrity means you cannot refer to any C linked-list implementation. If you
submit a solution that resembles such an online example, you are likely in breach of that rule
and may be subject to penalty.

## Downloading

To get the boilerplate code and the testing harness for this assignment, use the following
command on thoth:

```
wget {{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl }}/labs/03/queuelab-handout.zip
```

This will download the `queuelab-handout.zip` file to your (private) directory on the `thoth` Linux machine (make sure you are logged into this!) in which you will do your work.

Then issue the command:

```
unzip queuelab-handout.zip
```

This will cause a number of files to be unpacked in the directory `queuelab-handout`.
Navigate to that directory and look at the files.
The files you will be modifying are `queue.c` and `queue.h`.
The `queue.c` file contains a skeleton for the functions that interact with your queue data structure.
The `queue.h` file contains the function prototypes and the definition of the data structure.

Consult the `README` file for a more thorough description of the files and how to use them.

## Implementation

The `queue.h` file contains declarations which define the following structures:

```c
/* Linked list element */
typedef struct ELE {
    char* value;       /* The data held in our queue */
    struct ELE* next;  /* Next element in the list */
} list_ele_t;

/* Queue structure */
typedef struct {
    list_ele_t* head;  /* Linked list of elements */
} queue_t;
```

These two are combined to implement a queue of strings, as illustrated in the figure below.
The top-level representation of a queue is a structure of type `queue_t`.
In the starter code, this structure contains only a single field `head`, but you will likely
want to add other fields.
The queue contents are represented as a singly-linked list, with each element represented by
the `list_ele_t` structure having fields `value` and `next`.
The `value` field stores a pointer to a string.
The `next` field storing the pointer to another `list_ele_t` element representing the next
item in the list, or `NULL` when representing the end of the list.
You may add fields to the `list_ele_t` structure, but there is not a need to do so to complete
this lab for full credit.

![The queue structure showing a queue with a head field pointing to several list nodes. Each node has a string pointer with some random string value. The final node, labelled tail, is pointing to NULL.]({{ site.baseurl }}/labs/03/queuelab_fig1.png)

Recall that a string is represented in C as an array of `char` values.
In essentially every modern machine, a `char` is represented as a single byte.
To store a string of length `l` the array must be at least `l + 1` in size.
The first `l` elements storing the data of the string itself and the final element
storing the null-terminator (a byte with the explicit value of 0.)

The `value` field of the `list_ele_t` is a pointer to such an array. The figure
above shows the strings `cab`, `bead`, and `cab` represented as separate arrays.
The values for each character come from the [ASCII encoding](http://www.asciitable.com/)
where letters a through e are represented as hexadecimal values `0x61` through `0x65`.
Each list element should have its own unique copy of each string.

In our C code, a queue is a pointer of type `queue_t*`.
We distinguish two special cases.

* A `NULL` queue is one where the pointer has a value of `NULL`.
* An empty queue is one where the queue pointer itself is valid, but the `head` field points to `NULL`.

Your code must deal with being passed a queue of either of these types along with, of course,
a valid queue with one or more items.

## Your turn

Your task is to modify both the `queue.c` and `queue.h` files to fully implement the following functions:

* `q_new` - Create a new, empty queue.
* `q_free` - Deallocate everything associated with the given queue.
* `q_insert_head` - Attempt to add a new node to the beginning of the queue. (LIFO)
* `q_insert_tail` - Attempt to add a new node to the end of the queue in `O(1)` time. (FIFO)
* `q_remove_head` - Removes the head (first node) in the queue.
* `q_size` - Returns the number of items currently in the queue in `O(1)` time.
* `q_reverse` - Reverse the contents of the queue in place. That is, you cannot use any of the other functions nor deallocate/allocate nodes in the list.

Refer to the comments within `queue.c` for any guidance and rules for special cases for each function.

For functions that provide strings as arguments, you are expected to allocate and copy
those strings to the list. You will use `malloc` to create the space required for the
string and you can assume that the given string is well-formed (contains a null terminator).
Therefore, you do not need to assume any upper-bound on the string size. Just write your
code to work for any arbitrary string length.

Remember to account for null terminators in your string allocation!

Two functions, as indicated above, require an implementation that provides the performance
characteristic of constant time: `O(1)`. Doing this likely requires some thoughtful changes
to the `queue_t` structure and careful additional work in other functions.

Your program will be tested on queues of over 1,000,000 elements. Therefore, recursive
functions will not work because you will exhaust the alloted size of the stack. The OS
only gives you so much of it! Instead, you will have to always use loops to traverse
the items in your list.

## Testing

We have graciously provided a Makefile for this lab. As such, you can compile your work as so:

```
make
```

If there are no errors, the compiler will generate several programs. One program is `qtest`
which gives you an interactive interface in which to test your queue.
You can create, modify, and examine a queue.
Documentation on commands can be seen by running the `qtest` application and typing `help`:

```
./qtest
cmd> help
```

The following file (traces/trace-eg.cmd) illustrates an example command sequence:

```
# Demonstration of queue testing framework
# Use help command to see list of commands and options
# Initial queue is NULL.
show
# Create empty queue
new
# Fill it with some values.  First at the head
ih dolphin
ih bear
ih gerbil
# Now at the tail
it meerkat
it bear
# Reverse it
reverse
# See how long it is
size
# Delete queue.  Goes back to a NULL queue.
free
# Exit program
quit
```

You can use these commands yourself line-by-line with `qtest` or you can batch them from a file list this:

```
./qtest -f traces/trace-eg.cmd
```

With the starter code, you will see that many of these operations are not implemented properly.

The `traces` directory contains 15 trace files, with names of the form `trace-k-cat.txt`, where `k` is the trace number and `cat` specifies the category of properties being tested.
Each trace consists of a sequence of commands, similar to those shown above.
They test different aspects of the correctness, robustness, and performance of your program.
You can use these, your own trace files, and direct interactions with `qtest` to test and debug your program.

## Evaluation

Your program will be evaluated using the fifteen traces described above found in the `traces` directory of your handout package.
You will be given credit (either 6 or 7 points, depending on the trace) for each one that executes correctly, summing to a maximum score of 100.
This will be your score for the assignment, the grading being done completely automatically.

The driver program `driver.py` runs `qtest` on the traces and computes the score.
This is the same program that will be used to compute your score with Gradescope.
You can invoke the driver with the command:

```
make test
```

## Submission

In a change of pace, you will upload two files: `queue.c` and `queue.h` **and only these two files** to Gradescope.
You may submit as many times as you like until the due date.

## Reflection

It is good to start this assignment early.
C, like many things in life, takes practice.
This assignment stresses the importance of careful and deliberate programming.
Write short statements, do less on each line, and comment your code very liberally.

If you find yourself frustrated, take an hour away from it.
Come back to it with a fresh point of view.
Read the code over and what it does.
Remember that the computer is going to do exactly what it is told, so do not read back what you think you wrote.
Read what is actually there and if that is what you intended.

It may help to draw out a diagram of the data structure as you trace your own code.
You might find yourself, as I did, going, 

> "Ah, right, I can't assign `cur = cur->next` after I have done `cur->next = last`! I need to keep that pointer in a temp variable somewhere."

Mastery does not mean you always get it right on the first try.
