**Weight**: 10% of your total 50% Lab Grade

**Note**: DEFINITELY start early enough to get through the more troublesome parts of debugging this one!

## Introduction

In this assignment, you will implement a basic memory allocator much like the one
discussed in lecture. We will provide you with much of the boilerplate code to
start from.

This time we cannot use `malloc` and `free` to manage the data for our memory
allocator. We are implementing them ourselves!!

In this case, the two functions you will implement are `mm_malloc` and `mm_free` and you will implement them in three phases.
The first phase is the most naive implementation which will be a bit inefficient.
We will then improve this implementation to gain better performance.

## Downloading

To get the boilerplate code and the testing harness for this assignment, use the following
command on thoth:

```
wget {{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl }}/labs/04/malloclab-handout.zip
```

This will download the `malloclab-handout.zip` file to your (private) directory on the `thoth` Linux machine (make sure you are logged into this!) in which you will do your work.

Then issue the command:

```
unzip malloclab-handout.zip
```

This will cause a number of files to be unpacked in the directory `malloclab-handout`.
Navigate to that directory and look at the files.
The file you will be modifying is `mm.c`.
The `mm.c` file contains a skeleton for the functions that interact with the data structures that manage the state of memory.
It also contains the definition of the data structures we will use to represent the blocks on the heap.
The `mm.h` file contains just the function prototypes.

Consult the `README` file for a more thorough description of the files and how to use them.

## Implementation

The `mm.c` file contains declarations which define the following structures, which you do not need to modify:

```c
typedef struct _BlockInfo {
  // Size of the block and whether or not the block is in use or free.
  // When the size is negative, the block is currently free.
  long int size;
  // Pointer to the previous block in the list.
  struct _Block* prev;
} BlockInfo;

typedef struct _FreeBlockInfo {
  // Pointer to the next free block in the list.
  struct _Block* nextFree;
  // Pointer to the previous free block in the list.
  struct _Block* prevFree;
} FreeBlockInfo;

typedef struct _Block {
  BlockInfo info;
  FreeBlockInfo freeNode;
} Block;

/* Pointer to the first FreeBlockInfo in the free list, the list's head. */
static Block* free_list_head = NULL;
static Block* malloc_list_tail = NULL;
```

The important structure that you will use is the `Block` structure.
This contains the metadata for your block.

The `info` field of the structure is the metadata that is a part of *every* block
on the heap, free and allocated alike. The `freeNode` field is metadata that only
a free block has.

As a space optimization, you will allow the user program to write over the
`freeNode` information. In memory, the `info` struct comes before the `freeNode`
section in memory. If you placed the `Block` structure in memory, then if you
add `sizeof(BlockInfo)` to a pointer to a `Block` structure, it will be the
address of the `FreeBlockInfo` structure. It is *this* address that should be
returned by `mm_malloc` to make the best use of space.

You can ignore pointer arithmetic and add directly to a pointer using the
`UNSCALED_POINTER_ADD` macro we provided.

In this case, if you have a pointer to a `Block` called `ptrFreeBlock` and you
want `mm_malloc` to return the first address that a program can safely write
to, you can write:

```c
return UNSCALED_POINTER_ADD(ptrFreeBlock, sizeof(BlockInfo))
```

### Free Blocks

In this assignment, we are going to treat free blocks as being any `Block` that
has a negative `size`. An allocated block, then, is a `Block` that has a positive
`size`.

Here is some code that will determine if a `Block` is free:

```c
Block* ptrBlock = first_block();

if (ptrBlock->info.size < 0) {
    // Free Block
}
```

Notice the `ptrBlock->info` arrow syntax dereferencing the pointer to a `Block`
structure. Yet, since the `info` field is not a pointer, we directly refer to
the fields within. Therefore, `info.size` uses a dot syntax. Funky!

## Your turn

Your task is to modify both the `mm.c` file to fully implement the following functions:

* `mm_malloc` - Allocate a block of memory of the given size.
* `mm_free` - Deallocate the given pointer that was previously allocated by `mm_malloc`.

In the process of implementing these, you should find implementing these helper functions useful:
* `coalesce` - Given a free block, coalesce with its neighbors if they are also free.
* `searchList` - Look for a free block that can fit the given amount of space exhaustively.
* `searchFreeList` - Look for a free block that can fit the given amount of space by using the faster free list data structure.

We have provided quite a few helpful functions that will help you:

* `requestMoreSpace` - Will expand the heap by the given number of bytes.
* `mm_init` - This will reset the heap. You should not modify this.
* `first_block` - Will return a pointer to the first `Block` structure on the heap. It just assumes there is a `Block` structure written to the first bytes of the heap.
* `next_block` - When given a `Block` pointer, it will use the metadata to give you the next `Block` in memory. This assumes a properly managed heap where each `Block` is directly after the last one.
* `examine_heap` - Prints out the state of the heap assuming it is properly formed.
* `check_heap` - Checks your heap data structures for improper state. Can be useful for early debugging efforts.

Refer to the comments within `mm.c` for any guidance and rules for special cases for each function.
The implementations of provided functions can help you determine how to make use of other functions and how to properly read through your heap.

### Phase 1

In order to lessen the burden, it is recommended to implement this assignment in phases.
The first phase will be our least performant implementation.
It will be very naive and not use an explicit free list.
That is, we only use the `BlockInfo` metadata (`size` and `prev`) and ignore `FreeBlockInfo`
altogether. Do not worry about the free list just yet.

Also, do not worry about `coalesce` either.
Not coalescing blocks makes the memory manager very inefficient, but it will still give a
correct answer.

For this, when you allocate you only need to exhaustively find a block using `searchList` and
then, if you cannot find one, allocate more space to create a free block of the exact size
you need.

When you have such a block, you can then allocate it (adjust the size field such that it is
considered 'allocated').

If the block is large enough to split into two, then you should do so.

It should be helpful to maintain `malloc_list_tail` to always point to the `Block` at the
end of the heap (largest address.)
You only need to worry about `free_list_head` in phase 3.

Your `mm_free` implementation can just... mark it free again. How would we do that?

**Remember**: When you split a block, it needs enough space for all of the metadata!

### Phase 2

At this point, you should have a malloc implementation that passes all the tests, but
performs just miserably. Let's improve it, now.

Implement `coalesce()` such that adjacent free blocks are merged when `mm_free` is
called.

**Remember**: When you merge a block, the final block gains not only that block's
free space, but also the space taken up by the metadata!

### Phase 3

Adding `coalesce` should still result in a slightly better performing `mm_malloc`
implementation, and it should still pass all of its tests.

When you have a working implementation, we can add the final step: the free list.

The free list means making use of the `FreeBlockInfo` structure that is part of
every `Block`. This contains a `nextFree` and `prevFree` field. With this, we
can implement a single-ended doubly linked list to maintain a list of only the
free blocks.

In your `mm_malloc`, you will need to remove the node from the free list and
also carefully ensure the free block from a split is in the list.

In your `mm_free`, you will need to add a node to the head of the free list.
When you coalesce, you will need to ensure that the logic of the linked list
remains intact.

In the end, you should see a vast improvement in performance.

**Note/Hint**: These nodes do not have to be in any particular order.

## Testing

We have graciously provided a Makefile for this lab. As such, you can compile your work as so:

```
make
```

If there are no errors, the compiler will generate several programs. One program is `mdriver`
which will test your implementation against some exhaustive program traces.
Documentation on commands can be seen by running the `mdriver` with the `-h` flag:

```
./mdriver -h
```

The following file (traces/short1-bal.rep) illustrates an example trace:

```
20000
6
12
1
a 0 2040
a 1 2040
f 1
a 2 48
a 3 4072
f 3
a 4 4072
f 0
f 2
a 5 4072
f 4
f 5
```

You can mostly ignore the first few lines. Lines that start with `a` will call `mm_malloc` with the size
passed being the last number of that line. The lines starting with `f` will call `mm_free` with the
address returned by the corresponding `mm_malloc` call. That is, the prior `a` line of the trace with
the same identifying number (the second token on every `a` or `f` line).

You can write your own trace by copying an existing one.
To use any of the provided traces, just use `mdriver` like this:

```
./mdriver -f traces/short1-bal.rep
```

If there are no errors, it will print only one line which shows the relative performance of your
implementation.

You can run all traces using:

```
./mdriver
```

Generally, with the initial phase, you will be in the 40s running all traces. Your final
implementation in the final phase should be in the high 60s when running all traces.
It may deviate due to the server load.

## Evaluation

Your program will be evaluated using the thirteen traces described above found in the `traces` directory of your handout package.

## Submission

You only need to upload a single file `mm.c` to Gradescope for this assignment.
You may submit as many times as you like until the due date.

## Reflection

It is good to start this assignment early.
C, like many things in life, takes practice.
This assignment stresses the importance of careful and deliberate programming.
Write short statements, do less on each line, and comment your code very liberally.

If you find yourself frustrated, take an hour away from it.
Come back to it with a fresh point of view.
Read the code over and what it does.
Remember that the computer is going to do exactly what it is told, so do not read back what you think you wrote.
Read what is actually there and if that is what you intended.

It may help to draw out a diagram of the data structure as you trace your own code.
You might find yourself, as I did, going, 

> "Ah, right, I can't assign `cur = cur->next` after I have done `cur->next = last`! I need to keep that pointer in a temp variable somewhere."

Mastery does not mean you always get it right on the first try.
