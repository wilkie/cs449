Hello, all!

I have placed Lab 1 in its appropriate place and we now have the official lab section on the site.

Those in the M/W section should all have access to `thoth.cs.pitt.edu` and, soon, the remaining students in the T/Th section will join us.

Gradescope is not yet set up for submission of Lab 1, but will be done promptly before the official due date of this lab.

Due to the staggering of lectures, the due date for this lab is very comfortable for the M/W section since it is due next Friday (see the lab sheet for the exact and official date.)
That gives everybody at least a week to complete the assignment, which is very much more than necessary.

If you have problems accessing thoth, let me know immediately. Such a problem is not an excuse for submitting late.

Also note that the late penalty has been reduced to 10% per late day from 15%. The syllabus has changed to reflect that.

Thank you! And have fun!
