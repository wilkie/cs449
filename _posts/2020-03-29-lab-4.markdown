Hello, all!

Oh wow, I forgot to announce lab 3 here. Well, it is obvious that you all know it was there by now!

Lab 4 is a go! Take a look and experiment with the executables and tools. Doing some reverse-engineering this time... so no coding. Some of you will be relieved.

The first executable is one that should not take very long, so you could be 33% of the way done if no time at all if you start today!

This is also due in a little less than two weeks, which should be enough time.

Thank you! Happy hacking!
