Hello, all!

I have placed Lab 2 in its proper place. Please look over it as soon as you can!

This is also due in a little less than two weeks, which should be more than enough time.
Please start early to give yourself room the fully explore some of the more interesting questions.

These are also slightly puzzle oriented, but I have targetted the difficulty, I hope, a little better.
You will be implemented a couple of standard library functions, which are obviously very real-world things,
and also a classical sorting algorithm.

Hopefully this will let you see some of the more interesting benefits (and some drawbacks) of pointers in C!

I will try to have the Gradescope submission open in a couple of days. I am new to Gradescope and find it overwhelming right now and I want to be more confident that it is working. It is what it is. If you finish very early, and it is not available, just check the next day.

I appreciate your patience.

Thank you! And have fun!
