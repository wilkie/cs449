As always, keep up with the [University Academic Calendar](https://www.provost.pitt.edu/students/academic-calendar) for general important university dates.

Office hours for the instructor and TAs is listed at the [bottom of this page](#office-hours).

The schedule is always tentative. I may shift topics around.
