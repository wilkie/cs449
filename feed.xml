&lt;p&gt;I have placed Lab 2 in its proper place. Please look over it as soon as you can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also due in a little less than two weeks, which should be more than enough time.
Please start early to give yourself room the fully explore some of the more interesting questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are also slightly puzzle oriented, but I have targetted the difficulty, I hope, a little better.
You will be implemented a couple of standard library functions, which are obviously very real-world things,
and also a classical sorting algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will let you see some of the more interesting benefits (and some drawbacks) of pointers in C!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to have the Gradescope submission open in a couple of days. I am new to Gradescope and find it overwhelming right now and I want to be more confident that it is working. It is what it is. If you finish very early, and it is not available, just check the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate your patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you! And have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Hello, all!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lab 1 Released!</title><link href="https://wilkie.github.io/cs449/labs/2020/01/13/lab-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lab 1 Released!" /><published>2020-01-13T14:04:31-05:00</published><updated>2020-01-13T14:04:31-05:00</updated><id>https://wilkie.github.io/cs449/labs/2020/01/13/lab-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wilkie.github.io/cs449/labs/2020/01/13/lab-1.html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have placed Lab 1 in its appropriate place and we now have the official lab section on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those in the M/W section should all have access to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;thoth.cs.pitt.edu&lt;/code&gt; and, soon, the remaining students in the T/Th section will join us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradescope is not yet set up for submission of Lab 1, but will be done promptly before the official due date of this lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the staggering of lectures, the due date for this lab is very comfortable for the M/W section since it is due next Friday (see the lab sheet for the exact and official date.)
That gives everybody at least a week to complete the assignment, which is very much more than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have problems accessing thoth, let me know immediately. Such a problem is not an excuse for submitting late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that the late penalty has been reduced to 10% per late day from 15%. The syllabus has changed to reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you! And have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Hello, all!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to CS449!</title><link href="https://wilkie.github.io/cs449/jekyll/update/2020/01/05/welcome.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to CS449!" /><published>2020-01-05T14:04:31-05:00</published><updated>2020-01-05T14:04:31-05:00</updated><id>https://wilkie.github.io/cs449/jekyll/update/2020/01/05/welcome</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wilkie.github.io/cs449/jekyll/update/2020/01/05/welcome.html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, all!&lt;/p&gt;
